### A (definitely not) simple console-based OOP C++ Library Management Program that is able to retrieve books and library users to and from files.
___
This project was made with sweat and tears.
That reading just the first line of the instruction made me frozen.
It made me wonder, was choosing this program really the right choice?
The whole process of me coding this program felt like a crash course,
It felt like I was learning lots and lots by taking the massive dump of information regarding OOP in c++
But, at the same time, It felt like I haven't learnt a thing at all.
Ask me what a constructor is... I mean it is in it's name but what it does as well as how it's done? I absolutely have no idea.
The whole process of how this program was made was endless amount of searching on google, rechecking what a thing does in a website,
watching youtube videos from multiple channels, and even asking AI to check my code so that I can have a breath from debugging it.
It made me question who I am, and my values as a person.
It made me realize that, oh, yes, coding is absolutely hard,
but it's fun! 

It's fun if there are no deadlines.
